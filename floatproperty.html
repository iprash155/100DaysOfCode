            <p>A paragraph is a collection of words strung together to make a longer unit than a sentence. Several sentences often make to a paragraph. There are normally three to eight sentences in a paragraph. Paragraphs can start with a five-space indentation or by skipping a line and then starting over. This makes it simpler to tell when one paragraph ends and the next starts.</p>
